# 🚀 My Hands‑On NLP Journey

I rolled up my sleeves and built an end‑to‑end understanding of Natural Language Processing by actually doing the work — notebook after notebook, experiment after experiment. From raw text to working classifiers and topic models, I turned concepts into muscle memory.

---

### 🧠 What I Now Do Instinctively

*   Turn messy text into model‑ready data with confidence.
*   Choose the right representation (BoW, TF‑IDF, embeddings) for the task.
*   Ship quick baselines fast, then iterate to strong, explainable models.
*   Diagnose model behavior with metrics and error analysis, not guesswork.

### 🧹 Text Preprocessing Mastery

*   Lowercasing, punctuation handling, and whitespace normalization.
*   Stopword removal tuned for task sensitivity.
*   Regex‑powered text cleaning that preserves meaning.
*   Tokenization strategies for words, subwords, and edge cases.
*   Stemming vs. Lemmatization — when speed wins, when accuracy matters.
*   N‑grams to capture context without exploding sparsity.

### 🏷️ Linguistic Signal I Can Extract

*   POS tagging to add syntactic structure to features.
*   Named Entity Recognition to pull people, places, orgs, and more.
*   Rule‑based sentiment analysis to set reliable baselines.

### 🔢 Feature Engineering I’ve Shipped

*   Bag of Words and TF‑IDF with smart vocabulary/pruning.
*   Dimensionality reduction with LSA (SVD) for semantic structure.
*   Topic modeling with LDA for interpretable themes.

### 🧪 Models I Trained (No Code, All Results)

*   Classic ML pipelines for text classification (end‑to‑end).
*   Pre‑trained transformer models for modern benchmarks.
*   Combined/custom classifiers that blend features and heuristics.

### 📊 How I Validate and Improve

*   Train/validation/test splits that reflect the real world.
*   Metrics that matter (accuracy, precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix).
*   Error analysis loops to fix data issues, not just tweak knobs.
*   Reproducible experiments with clean data and documented configs.

### 🧰 Tools & Ecosystem I’m Comfortable With

*   Python data stack for NLP workflows.
*   Tokenizers, vectorizers, and model APIs across popular libraries.
*   Notebooks for rapid iteration and storytelling with results.

### 🧭 Projects and Practicals I Completed

*   Preprocessing pipelines from raw text files to features.
*   Baseline → improved text classifiers (rule‑based to ML).
*   POS/NER tagging demos with real‑world text.
*   Sentiment analysis from rules to model‑driven approaches.
*   Topic discovery with LDA/LSA and interpretation.
*   Transformer‑based experimentation to benchmark gains.

### 🚧 What’s Next

*   Fine‑tuning transformers for task‑specific gains.
*   Robust evaluation on noisy, domain‑specific datasets.
*   Lightweight deployment patterns for text models in production.
